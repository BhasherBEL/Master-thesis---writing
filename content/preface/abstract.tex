\chapter*{Abstract}

This Master's thesis presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a mobile application aimed at enhancing museum visitor experiences through a location-aware system that delivers contextually relevant information based on visitors' locations. The system was deployed on the sixth floor of the Mus√©e L in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. It utilized a Flutter-based mobile application to scan and analyze signal strength from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, implemented using ESP32 devices, in order to estimate visitor positions. Real-time location tracking was achieved through a multi-lateration algorithm, resulting in a median localization error of 2.8 meters. Additionally, the system accurately identified the visitor's area within the museum with over 80\% accuracy. The application featured a user-friendly interface that enabled visitors to interact with the system and access information relevant to nearby exhibits.
