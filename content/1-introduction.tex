% Why IPS in a Museum?
% Which museums issues, technology can help fixing

% Passive approach is meh
% Not accessible

% In the last decade, museums have faced increasing competition and financial challenges due to reduced government support, making it essential for them to innovate digitally in order to enhance the visitor experience and remain central to urban tourism destinations striving to achieve sustainable development goals through cultural and heritage attractions.

% shift from product orientation to consumer orientation
% In the last decade, museums have been struggling due to increased competition and are scrambling for funds due to a reduction in government support
% information and communications technologies enhance experiences for visitors

Over the past decade, museums have faced growing competition and financial challenges due to decreased government funding. It enforced many of them to shift from product orientation to consumer orientation  \cite{chiappa_emotions_2014}. Information and communications technologies can help to pursue this goal by enhancing visitor experience.

\section{Introduction to IPS}

% What's IPS

Most of the systems allows to captures useful analytics about the visitors' retention time \cite{spachos_ble_2020}.

Indoor localization is a vast subject, covered widely in the papers, and with a lot of different approach. While some papers use the existing infrastructure, such as the Wi-Fi or the FM and the user's devices, others require a specific installation or don't use the user's device. Even if this factor is not widely discussed in the technical papers, they may have a non-negligible environmental and social impact.

There is many indoor localization systems, and they all have their pro and cons depending on their application context. Some may require installation of new hardware, while other use the already available infrastructure \cite{ali_locali_2017}. Some require the user to carry a specialized device, and others can rely only on the users' smartphone, or even on the presence of the user itself, without any device.

Indoor localization depends on trade-off among performance parameters, user requirements and environmental conditions \cite{mainetti_survey_2014}.
