    abstract = {This paper applies selected methodologies for the measurement of the environmental and economic sustainability of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection (PGC) in Venice with a view to assessing the PGC’s sustainability and commitment to implementing selected SDGs. To assess environmental sustainability, a life cycle assessment (LCA) has been carried out. The museum is conceptualized as a “firm” that produces several outputs and needs several inputs. The results provide the number of annual CO2e (and other pollutants) emissions linked to the regular activity of the museum. The environmental cost (in EUR), linked to the impacts obtained from LCA, has been calculated. To assess economic sustainability, a survey and econometric methods were used to value services directly generated by the museum, and input/output methods were used to compute the direct and indirect impacts on the local economy. Nonetheless, PGC visitors (those who travel to Venice with the main objective of visiting the PGC) contribute to around 1.2\%/1.4\% of Venice’s GDP. The results from input–output tables show that, although the final demand generated by the PGC’s own activities amounted to about EUR 620 million in 2022, the economic benefits of the PGC beyond this final demand are significant and very positive due to carry-over effects. Specifically, the PGC leads to an increase in GDP of around EUR 1.200 million, with a multiplier of 1.9. In terms of employment, around 8200 jobs are associated with the presence of the PGC. The net public finance revenue also clearly benefits, with a net income of around EUR 150 million in 2022. Comparing both the environmental and economic impacts of the PGC, one can conclude that the annual activities performed by the museum are highly sustainable, with the economic pillar strongly offsetting the costs generated using natural resources. The creation of economic value, therefore, is generated in respect of environmental boundaries, even if some minor flaws can be highlighted. The connection between museums and sustainable development goals is highly recognized. The findings show the PGC’s commitment to achieving and implementing selected SDGs, including SDG 4, SDG 11, and SDG 16, by implementing actions and strategies that are aligned with these goals.},

    abstract = {The 2030 Agenda and the sustainable development goals (SDGs) constitute a new global roadmap for all institutions and sectors of society. Therefore, thanks to the initiative of Club of Córdoba for the Unesco (CUCO), a nonprofit association, in collaboration with the University of Cordoba, the need to create a tool for heritage management has been identified to guide personnel responsible for cultural heritage resources in the implementation of SDGs. The goal of this universal guide is to raise awareness of the importance of cultural heritage resources being aligned with the 2030 Agenda and provide the keys to apply the SDGs in the day-to-day activities of the different institutions. This publication is part of the proyect of the Junta de Andalucía “The Guide to Action on a Heritage Resource on the SDGs” (GARPODS).,SDG Compass is a powerful tool for the application of the SDGs in the business field and therefore has been considered appropriate to create a guide for cultural heritage resources based on it. To this end, we have held meetings with experts in the heritage field (directors and managers of different heritage resources in the province of Córdoba) both individually and collectively. Surveys have also been carried out on different interest groups (managers, employees, suppliers, visitors) which in turn have made it possible to provide an interdisciplinary nature to the sample and the results.,With the completion of this work, it has been proven that cultural heritage resource managers lack the necessary knowledge and resources to implement the SDGs in their management. Therefore, the proposed guide will be a practical tool that will allow all heritage resources to incorporate the SDGs into their management.,The tool proposed in this work, although it based on the SDG Compass methodology, aims to go beyond the business sphere and adapt to heritage resources so that they can apply the SDGs in their management. This work is ongoing and the full guide will be presented in February 2024.},
