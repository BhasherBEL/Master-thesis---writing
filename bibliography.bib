	abstract = {This paper aims to provide the reader with a review of the main technologies explored in the literature to solve the indoor localization issue. Furthermore, some systems that use these enabling technologies in real-world scenarios are presented and discussed. This could deliver a better understanding of the state-of-the-art and motivate new research efforts in this promising field. Finally, focusing on one of the major challenges in the indoor localization field, i.e., the indoor animal tracking, existing indoor tracking systems have been reviewed and compared by analyzing advantages and drawbacks.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of wireless communication technology, various indoor location-based services ({ILBSs}) have gradually penetrated into daily life. Although many other methods have been proposed to be applied to {ILBS} in the past decade, {WiFi}-based positioning techniques with a wide range of infrastructure have attracted attention in the field of wireless transmission. In this survey, the authors divide {WiFi}-based indoor positioning techniques into the active positioning technique and the passive positioning technique based on whether the target carries certain devices. After reviewing a large number of excellent papers in the related field, the authors make a detailed summary of these two types of positioning techniques. In addition, they also analyse the challenges and future development trends in the current technological environment.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in indoor positioning systems are based on infrastructure-free solutions, aimed at improving the location accuracy in complex indoor environments without the use of specialized resources. A popular infrastructure-free solution for indoor positioning is a calibration-based positioning, commonly known as fingerprinting. Fingerprinting solutions require extensive and error-free surveys of environments to build radio-map databases, which play a key role in position estimation. Fingerprinting also requires random updates of the database, when there are significant changes in the environment or a decrease in the accuracy. The calibration of the fingerprinting database is a time-consuming and laborious effort that prevents the extensive adoption of this technique. In this paper, we present a systematic {LOCALIzation} approach, “{LOCALI}”, for indoor positioning, which does not require a calibration database and extensive updates. The {LOCALI} exploits the floor plan/wall map of the environment to estimate the target position by generating radio maps by integrating path-losses over certain trajectories in complex indoor environments, where triangulation using time information or the received signal strength level is highly erroneous due to the fading effects caused by multi-path propagation or absorption by environmental elements or varying antenna alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that by using the map information and environmental parameters, a significant level of accuracy in indoor positioning can be achieved. Moreover, this process requires considerably lesser effort compared to the calibration-based techniques.},

    abstract = {The potential of Information and Communication Technology-enhanced visitor learning experience is increasing with the advancement of new and emerging technologies in art gallery settings. However, studies on the visitor learning experience using wearable devices, and in particular, those investigating the effects of wearable augmented reality on the learning experience within cultural heritage tourism attractions are limited. Using the generic learning outcomes framework, this study aims to assess how the wearable augmented reality application enhances visitor’s learning experiences. Forty-four volunteers who were visiting an art gallery were divided into two groups, an experimental group and a control group. Following their visit to the gallery, the volunteers, who had and had not used wearable computing equipment, were interviewed, and the data were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings revealed that the wearable augmented reality application helps visitors to see connections between paintings and personalize their learning experience. However, there are some drawbacks such as lack of visitor–visitor engagement and the social acceptability.},
