Although many other methods have been proposed to be applied to {ILBS} in the past decade, {WiFi}-based positioning techniques with a wide range of infrastructure have attracted attention in the field of wireless transmission. In this survey, the authors divide {WiFi}-based indoor positioning techniques into the active positioning technique and the passive positioning technique based on whether the target carries certain devices. After reviewing a large number of excellent papers in the related field, the authors make a detailed summary of these two types of positioning techniques.

	abstract = {Recent advancements in indoor positioning systems are based on infrastructure-free solutions, aimed at improving the location accuracy in complex indoor environments without the use of specialized resources. A popular infrastructure-free solution for indoor positioning is a calibration-based positioning, commonly known as fingerprinting. Fingerprinting solutions require extensive and error-free surveys of environments to build radio-map databases, which play a key role in position estimation. Fingerprinting also requires random updates of the database, when there are significant changes in the environment or a decrease in the accuracy. The calibration of the fingerprinting database is a time-consuming and laborious effort that prevents the extensive adoption of this technique. In this paper, we present a systematic {LOCALIzation} approach, “{LOCALI}”, for indoor positioning, which does not require a calibration database and extensive updates. The {LOCALI} exploits the floor plan/wall map of the environment to estimate the target position by generating radio maps by integrating path-losses over certain trajectories in complex indoor environments, where triangulation using time information or the received signal strength level is highly erroneous due to the fading effects caused by multi-path propagation or absorption by environmental elements or varying antenna alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that by using the map information and environmental parameters, a significant level of accuracy in indoor positioning can be achieved. Moreover, this process requires considerably lesser effort compared to the calibration-based techniques.},

However, studies on the visitor learning experience using wearable devices, and in particular, those investigating the effects of wearable augmented reality on the learning experience within cultural heritage tourism attractions are limited. Using the generic learning outcomes framework, this study aims to assess how the wearable augmented reality application enhances visitor’s learning experiences. Forty-four volunteers who were visiting an art gallery were divided into two groups, an experimental group and a control group. Following their visit to the gallery, the volunteers, who had and had not used wearable computing equipment, were interviewed, and the data were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings revealed that the wearable augmented reality application helps visitors to see connections between paintings and personalize their learning experience. However, there are some drawbacks such as lack of visitor–visitor engagement and the social acceptability.},

    abstract = {An indoor localization system based on the RSSI-APIT algorithm is designed in this study. Integrated RSSI (received signal strength indication) and non-ranging APIT (approximate perfect point-in-triangulation test) localization methods are fused with machine learning in order to improve the accuracy of the indoor localization system. The system focuses on the improvement of preprocessing and localization algorithms. The primary objective of the system is to enhance the preprocessing of the acquired RSSI data and optimize the localization algorithm in order to enhance the precision of the coordinates in the indoor localization system. In order to mitigate the issue of significant fluctuations in RSSI, a technique including the integration of Gaussian filtering and an artificial neural network (ANN) is employed. This approach aims to preprocess the acquired RSSI data, thus reducing the impact of multipath effects. In order to address the issue of low localization accuracy encountered by the conventional APIT localization algorithm during wide-area localization, the RSSI ranging function is incorporated into the APIT localization algorithm. This addition serves to further narrow down the localization area. Consequently, the resulting localization algorithm is referred to as the RSSI-APIT positioning algorithm. Experimental results have demonstrated the successful reduction of inherent localization errors within the system by employing the RSSI-APIT positioning algorithm. The present study aims to investigate the impact of the localization scene and the number of anchors on the RSSI-APIT localization algorithm, with the objective of enhancing the performance of the indoor localization system. The conducted experiments demonstrated that the enhanced system exhibits several advantages. Firstly, it successfully decreased the frequency of anchor calls, resulting in a reduction in the overall operating cost of the system. Additionally, it effectively enhanced the accuracy and stability of the system’s localization capabilities. In a complex environment of 100 m2 in size, compared with the traditional trilateral localization method and the APIT localization algorithm, the RSSI-APIT localization algorithm reduced the localization error by about 2.9 m and 1.8 m, respectively, and the overall error was controlled within 1.55 m.},

    abstract = {Widespread proliferation of wireless coverage has enabled culmination of number of advanced location-based services (LBS). Continuous tracking of accurate physical location is the foundation of these services, which is a challenging task especially indoors. Multitude of techniques and algorithms have been proposed for indoor positioning systems (IPS’s). However, accuracy, reliability, scalability and, adaptability to the environment still remain as challenges for widespread deployment. Especially, unpredictable radio propagation characteristics in vastly varying indoor environments plus access technology limitations contribute to these challenges. Machine learning (ML) approaches have been widely attempted recently to overcome these challenges with reasonable success. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey of ML enabled localization techniques using most common wireless technologies. First, we provide a brief background on indoor localization techniques. Afterwards, we discuss various ML techniques (supervised and unsupervised) that could alleviate different challenges in indoor localization including Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) issue, device heterogeneity and environmental variations with reasonable complexity. The trade-offs among multitude of issues are discussed using numerous published results. We also discuss how the ML algorithms can be effectively used for fusing different technologies and algorithms to achieve a comprehensive IPS. In essence, this survey will serve as a reference material to acquire a detailed knowledge on recent development of machine learning for accurate indoor positioning.},

    abstract = {A low-cost yet effective localization scheme for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is presented in this study. The proposed scheme uses only two anchor nodes and uses bilateration to estimate the coordinates of unknown nodes. Many localization algorithms for WSNs require the installation of extra components, such as a GPS, ultrasonic transceiver, and unidirectional antenna, to sensors. The proposed localization scheme is range-free (i.e., not demanding any extra devices for the sensors). In this scheme, two anchor nodes are installed at the bottom-left corner (Sink X) and the bottom-right corner (Sink Y) of a square monitored region of the WSN. Sensors are identified with the same minimum hop counts pair to Sink X and Sink Y to form a zone, and the estimated location of each unknown sensor is adjusted according to its relative position in the zone. This study compares the proposed scheme with the well-known DV-Hop method. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the DV-Hop method in localization accuracy, communication cost, and computational complexity.},

    abstract = {This paper proposes a fingerprint-based indoor localization method, named FPFE (fingerprint feature extraction), to locate a target device (TD) whose location is unknown. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon nodes (BNs) are deployed in the localization area to emit beacon packets periodically. The received signal strength indication (RSSI) values of beacon packets sent by various BNs are measured at different reference points (RPs) and saved as RPs’ fingerprints in a database. For the purpose of localization, the TD also obtains its fingerprint by measuring the beacon packet RSSI values for various BNs. FPFE then applies either the autoencoder (AE) or principal component analysis (PCA) to extract fingerprint features. It then measures the similarity between the features of PRs and the TD with the Minkowski distance. Afterwards, k RPs associated with the k smallest Minkowski distances are selected to estimate the TD’s location. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the localization error of FPFE. The experimental results show that FPFE achieves an average error of 0.68 m, which is better than those of other related BLE fingerprint-based indoor localization methods.},

The localization information is obtained by a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) infrastructure installed in the museum. Moreover, the system interacts with the Cloud to store multimedia contents produced by the user and to share environment-generated events on his/her social networks. Finally, several location-aware services, running in the system, control the environment status also according to users' movements. These services interact with physical devices through a multiprotocol middleware. The system has been designed to be easily extensible to other IoT technologies and its effectiveness has been evaluated in the MUST museum, Lecce, Italy.},

The solution presented in this paper was created for the Foz Côa Museum in Portugal and was tested in the real environment. A detailed study was carried out to analyze the RSSI under four different scenarios, and detection tests were carried out that allowed us to measure the accuracy of the room identification, which is needed for proper content delivery. Of the 89 positions tested in the four scenarios, 70\% of the received signals were correctly received throughout the entire duration of the tests, 20\% were received in an intermittent way, 4\% were never detected and 6\% of unwanted beacons were detected. The signal detection is fundamental for the correct room identification, which was performed with 96\% accuracy. Thus, we verified that this technology is suitable for the proposed solution.},
