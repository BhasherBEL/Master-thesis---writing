	abstract = {The 2030 Agenda and the sustainable development goals (SDGs) constitute a new global roadmap for all institutions and sectors of society. Therefore, thanks to the initiative of Club of Córdoba for the Unesco (CUCO), a nonprofit association, in collaboration with the University of Cordoba, the need to create a tool for heritage management has been identified to guide personnel responsible for cultural heritage resources in the implementation of SDGs. The goal of this universal guide is to raise awareness of the importance of cultural heritage resources being aligned with the 2030 Agenda and provide the keys to apply the SDGs in the day-to-day activities of the different institutions. This publication is part of the proyect of the Junta de Andalucía “The Guide to Action on a Heritage Resource on the SDGs” (GARPODS).,SDG Compass is a powerful tool for the application of the SDGs in the business field and therefore has been considered appropriate to create a guide for cultural heritage resources based on it. To this end, we have held meetings with experts in the heritage field (directors and managers of different heritage resources in the province of Córdoba) both individually and collectively. Surveys have also been carried out on different interest groups (managers, employees, suppliers, visitors) which in turn have made it possible to provide an interdisciplinary nature to the sample and the results.,With the completion of this work, it has been proven that cultural heritage resource managers lack the necessary knowledge and resources to implement the SDGs in their management. Therefore, the proposed guide will be a practical tool that will allow all heritage resources to incorporate the SDGs into their management.,The tool proposed in this work, although it based on the SDG Compass methodology, aims to go beyond the business sphere and adapt to heritage resources so that they can apply the SDGs in their management. This work is ongoing and the full guide will be presented in February 2024.},

	abstract = {This paper applies selected methodologies for the measurement of the environmental and economic sustainability of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection (PGC) in Venice with a view to assessing the PGC’s sustainability and commitment to implementing selected SDGs. To assess environmental sustainability, a life cycle assessment (LCA) has been carried out. The museum is conceptualized as a “firm” that produces several outputs and needs several inputs. The results provide the number of annual CO2e (and other pollutants) emissions linked to the regular activity of the museum. The environmental cost (in EUR), linked to the impacts obtained from LCA, has been calculated. To assess economic sustainability, a survey and econometric methods were used to value services directly generated by the museum, and input/output methods were used to compute the direct and indirect impacts on the local economy. Nonetheless, PGC visitors (those who travel to Venice with the main objective of visiting the PGC) contribute to around 1.2\%/1.4\% of Venice’s GDP. The results from input–output tables show that, although the final demand generated by the PGC’s own activities amounted to about EUR 620 million in 2022, the economic benefits of the PGC beyond this final demand are significant and very positive due to carry-over effects. Specifically, the PGC leads to an increase in GDP of around EUR 1.200 million, with a multiplier of 1.9. In terms of employment, around 8200 jobs are associated with the presence of the PGC. The net public finance revenue also clearly benefits, with a net income of around EUR 150 million in 2022. Comparing both the environmental and economic impacts of the PGC, one can conclude that the annual activities performed by the museum are highly sustainable, with the economic pillar strongly offsetting the costs generated using natural resources. The creation of economic value, therefore, is generated in respect of environmental boundaries, even if some minor flaws can be highlighted. The connection between museums and sustainable development goals is highly recognized. The findings show the PGC’s commitment to achieving and implementing selected SDGs, including SDG 4, SDG 11, and SDG 16, by implementing actions and strategies that are aligned with these goals.},

This paper presents an indoor location system and content delivery solution, based on Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons, that enable visitors to walk freely inside the museum and receive augmented reality content based on the acquired position, which is done using the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). The solution presented in this paper was created for the Foz Côa Museum in Portugal and was tested in the real environment. A detailed study was carried out to analyze the RSSI under four different scenarios, and detection tests were carried out that allowed us to measure the accuracy of the room identification, which is needed for proper content delivery. Of the 89 positions tested in the four scenarios, 70\% of the received signals were correctly received throughout the entire duration of the tests, 20\% were received in an intermittent way, 4\% were never detected and 6\% of unwanted beacons were detected. The signal detection is fundamental for the correct room identification, which was performed with 96\% accuracy. Thus, we verified that this technology is suitable for the proposed solution.},

Finally, several location-aware services, running in the system, control the environment status also according to users' movements.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a fingerprint-based indoor localization method, named FPFE (fingerprint feature extraction), to locate a target device (TD) whose location is unknown. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon nodes (BNs) are deployed in the localization area to emit beacon packets periodically. The received signal strength indication (RSSI) values of beacon packets sent by various BNs are measured at different reference points (RPs) and saved as RPs’ fingerprints in a database. For the purpose of localization, the TD also obtains its fingerprint by measuring the beacon packet RSSI values for various BNs. FPFE then applies either the autoencoder (AE) or principal component analysis (PCA) to extract fingerprint features. It then measures the similarity between the features of PRs and the TD with the Minkowski distance. Afterwards, k RPs associated with the k smallest Minkowski distances are selected to estimate the TD’s location. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the localization error of FPFE. The experimental results show that FPFE achieves an average error of 0.68 m, which is better than those of other related BLE fingerprint-based indoor localization methods.},

	abstract = {A low-cost yet effective localization scheme for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is presented in this study. The proposed scheme uses only two anchor nodes and uses bilateration to estimate the coordinates of unknown nodes. Many localization algorithms for WSNs require the installation of extra components, such as a GPS, ultrasonic transceiver, and unidirectional antenna, to sensors. The proposed localization scheme is range-free (i.e., not demanding any extra devices for the sensors). In this scheme, two anchor nodes are installed at the bottom-left corner (Sink X) and the bottom-right corner (Sink Y) of a square monitored region of the WSN. Sensors are identified with the same minimum hop counts pair to Sink X and Sink Y to form a zone, and the estimated location of each unknown sensor is adjusted according to its relative position in the zone. This study compares the proposed scheme with the well-known DV-Hop method. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the DV-Hop method in localization accuracy, communication cost, and computational complexity.},

	abstract = {Widespread proliferation of wireless coverage has enabled culmination of number of advanced location-based services (LBS). Continuous tracking of accurate physical location is the foundation of these services, which is a challenging task especially indoors. Multitude of techniques and algorithms have been proposed for indoor positioning systems (IPS’s). However, accuracy, reliability, scalability and, adaptability to the environment still remain as challenges for widespread deployment. Especially, unpredictable radio propagation characteristics in vastly varying indoor environments plus access technology limitations contribute to these challenges. Machine learning (ML) approaches have been widely attempted recently to overcome these challenges with reasonable success. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey of ML enabled localization techniques using most common wireless technologies. First, we provide a brief background on indoor localization techniques. Afterwards, we discuss various ML techniques (supervised and unsupervised) that could alleviate different challenges in indoor localization including Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) issue, device heterogeneity and environmental variations with reasonable complexity. The trade-offs among multitude of issues are discussed using numerous published results. We also discuss how the ML algorithms can be effectively used for fusing different technologies and algorithms to achieve a comprehensive IPS. In essence, this survey will serve as a reference material to acquire a detailed knowledge on recent development of machine learning for accurate indoor positioning.},

	abstract = {An indoor localization system based on the RSSI-APIT algorithm is designed in this study. Integrated RSSI (received signal strength indication) and non-ranging APIT (approximate perfect point-in-triangulation test) localization methods are fused with machine learning in order to improve the accuracy of the indoor localization system. The system focuses on the improvement of preprocessing and localization algorithms. The primary objective of the system is to enhance the preprocessing of the acquired RSSI data and optimize the localization algorithm in order to enhance the precision of the coordinates in the indoor localization system. In order to mitigate the issue of significant fluctuations in RSSI, a technique including the integration of Gaussian filtering and an artificial neural network (ANN) is employed. This approach aims to preprocess the acquired RSSI data, thus reducing the impact of multipath effects. In order to address the issue of low localization accuracy encountered by the conventional APIT localization algorithm during wide-area localization, the RSSI ranging function is incorporated into the APIT localization algorithm. This addition serves to further narrow down the localization area. Consequently, the resulting localization algorithm is referred to as the RSSI-APIT positioning algorithm. Experimental results have demonstrated the successful reduction of inherent localization errors within the system by employing the RSSI-APIT positioning algorithm. The present study aims to investigate the impact of the localization scene and the number of anchors on the RSSI-APIT localization algorithm, with the objective of enhancing the performance of the indoor localization system. The conducted experiments demonstrated that the enhanced system exhibits several advantages. Firstly, it successfully decreased the frequency of anchor calls, resulting in a reduction in the overall operating cost of the system. Additionally, it effectively enhanced the accuracy and stability of the system’s localization capabilities. In a complex environment of 100 m2 in size, compared with the traditional trilateral localization method and the APIT localization algorithm, the RSSI-APIT localization algorithm reduced the localization error by about 2.9 m and 1.8 m, respectively, and the overall error was controlled within 1.55 m.},

The MCL was upgraded from Markov localization, with both belonging to the family of probabilistic approaches. Throughout the last decade, laser rangefinders and gyroscopes have been applied to MCL-based robotic localization systems with remarkable success. However, the utilization of MCL-based indoor localization for mobile devices, by applying Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors, is still being researched. In this paper, we present a technique that utilizes MCL that exploits two sensors, namely, the accelerometer and compass, with commonly deployed BLE beacons to localize people with mobile devices indoors. Experimental results illustrate that, by applying MCL with BLE beacons using an accelerometer and compass, the error of the calculated coordinates for the user position is less than 1 m in line of-sight (LOS) environments, while in a complex non-LOS environment, the average error is 3 m. Meanwhile, the proposed MCL system does not demand a high deployment density of BLE beacons compared with triangulation and trilateration-based indoor positioning algorithms.},

Results are integrated into a weighted framework in order to increase the adaptability of the proposed localization algorithm to different complex environments and increase the accuracy of the localization. Three experiments in different environments have been examined in order to test the performance and the limitations of this algorithm. Results show that the proposed algorithm demonstrated strong adaptability to complex non-Line-of-Sight (LOS) environments.},

Thus, we analysed three interrelated streams of literature (digital innovation, tourism management and stakeholder theory) and we developed a conceptual paper that sheds light on AR in museums. An in-depth analysis of the topic allowed us to develop theoretical propositions and applications on the subject, in particular from a multi-stakeholder perspective.

Outdoor localization can use GPS, AGPS (Assisted Global Positioning System) [6], but in buildings like supermarkets and underground parking, the accuracy of GPS and even AGPS will be greatly reduced. Since Indoor localization requests higher accuracy, using GPS or AGPS for indoor localization is not feasible in the current view. RSSI-based trilateral localization algorithm, due to its low cost, no additional hardware support, and easy-understanding, it becomes the mainstream localization algorithm in wireless sensor networks. With the development of wireless sensor networks and smart devices, the number of WIFI access point in these buildings is increasing, as long as a mobile smart device can detect three or three more known WIFI hotspots’ positions, it would be relatively easy to realize self-localization (Usually WIFI access points locations are fixed). The key problem is that the RSSI value is relatively vulnerable to the influence of the physical environment, causing large calculation error in RSSI-based localization algorithm. The paper proposes an improved RSSI-based algorithm, the experimental results show that compared with original RSSI-based localization algorithms the algorithm improves the localization accuracy and reduces the deviation.},

Firstly, use FM data collection device to obtain RSSI fingerprint information within the coverage area, and train them to build a fingerprint database; secondly, KNN technology is used to complete the rough localization calculation based on the RSSI data received by the module to be located, the RSSI fingerprint database and environmental noise parameters; finally, the Kalman filter model is used to predict and optimize the rough position information, so as to have better environmental adaptability and effectively improve the accuracy of localization.

To realize the automatic guidance and navigation, we present a new data architecture to contain the location information, and an evaluation function to calculate the optical exhibition candidates for the visitors. The feature of the function is considering the popularity of the exhibition and movement distance between the exhibition spots. To implement the service, we developed an application to support editing the map, and create the map data for the portable terminals.

	abstract = {The accelerating advancement of 5G networks, Internet of Things, and data processing methods in the 21st century raised people's demand for location-based services, especially the indoor locating services. Therefore, indoor locating services have gradually replaced outdoor locating services to become a new research focus and challenge. Given that the traditional indoor locating systems, which are largely based on positioning technologies such as WiFi and radar, performed unsatisfactorily in terms of cost and, the most vital, accuracy.The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has become the core of the Internet of Things and has been widely utilized to tackle the difficulties in the indoor location during the past ten years. The present study analyzed and compared the working principles, research status, and the pros and cons of several commonly used wireless sensors, and drew a conclusion that single indoor locating technology inevitably comes with corresponding limitations, which can be solved through the combination of multiple complementary locating technology. This paper employed UWB and BLE as the subsystems of the indoor combination locating system, analyzed and optimized the respective locating algorithm model of each subsystem, and proposes an optimization model for combination locating algorithm based on EKF-PF, to enhance the accuracy. Eventually, we built a novel set of low-cost, convenient and flexible indoor combination locating system based on Bluetooth-UWB technology that supports both two-dimensional and three-dimensional spatial location.},

Locating and tracking objects within an indoor environment plays an important role in Internet of Things application and service. However, it is a challenging problem to achieve high accuracy using WiFi positioning technique due to the high instability in received signal strength from AP. Thus, it is desirable to select APs by considering both signal strength and connection quality. In this article, an AP selection algorithm based on multiobjective optimization is proposed to improve indoor WiFi positioning accuracy. The self-adaptive AP selection algorithm can be easily applied to various real scenarios and the performance of the new method is considerably better than classical algorithms. Learning algorithm is exploited to obtain the optimal solution for the self-adaptive AP selection algorithm. Experiments are conducted and the proposed algorithm is compared with classical algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the self-adaptive AP selection algorithm is at least a few decimeters better than classical algorithms in terms of RMSE of position estimation. Meanwhile, the new method is robust to the random generation of initial particles and normalizing factor as their effect on the positional accuracy is less than 1 decimeter.},

Based on such sensors, many commercial AR toolkits and public benchmark datasets have been made available to accelerate hatching and validating new ideas. To lower the difficulty and enhance the flexibility in accessing the rich raw data of typical AR sensors on mobile devices, this paper present the mobile AR sensor (MARS) logger for two of the most popular mobile operating systems, Android and iOS. The logger highlights the best possible synchronization between the camera and the IMU allowed by a mobile device, and efficient saving of images at about 30Hz, and recording the metadata relevant to AR applications. This logger has been tested on a relatively large spectrum of mobile devices, and the collected data has been used for analyzing the sensor characteristics.

	abstract = {Recent advancements in indoor positioning systems are based on infrastructure-free solutions, aimed at improving the location accuracy in complex indoor environments without the use of specialized resources. A popular infrastructure-free solution for indoor positioning is a calibration-based positioning, commonly known as fingerprinting. Fingerprinting solutions require extensive and error-free surveys of environments to build radio-map databases, which play a key role in position estimation. Fingerprinting also requires random updates of the database, when there are significant changes in the environment or a decrease in the accuracy. The calibration of the fingerprinting database is a time-consuming and laborious effort that prevents the extensive adoption of this technique. In this paper, we present a systematic LOCALIzation approach, “LOCALI”, for indoor positioning, which does not require a calibration database and extensive updates. The LOCALI exploits the floor plan/wall map of the environment to estimate the target position by generating radio maps by integrating path-losses over certain trajectories in complex indoor environments, where triangulation using time information or the received signal strength level is highly erroneous due to the fading effects caused by multi-path propagation or absorption by environmental elements or varying antenna alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that by using the map information and environmental parameters, a significant level of accuracy in indoor positioning can be achieved. Moreover, this process requires considerably lesser effort compared to the calibration-based techniques.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of wireless communication technology, various indoor location-based services (ILBSs) have gradually penetrated into daily life. Although many other methods have been proposed to be applied to ILBS in the past decade, WiFi-based positioning techniques with a wide range of infrastructure have attracted attention in the field of wireless transmission. In this survey, the authors divide WiFi-based indoor positioning techniques into the active positioning technique and the passive positioning technique based on whether the target carries certain devices. After reviewing a large number of excellent papers in the related field, the authors make a detailed summary of these two types of positioning techniques. In addition, they also analyse the challenges and future development trends in the current technological environment.},

	abstract = {Indoor positioning systems based on wireless local area networks are growing rapidly in importance and gaining commercial interest. Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) systems, which rely on inertial sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, or even magnetometers to estimate users’ movement, have also been widely adopted for real-time indoor pedestrian location tracking. Since both kinds of systems have their own advantages and disadvantages, a maximum likelihood-based fusion algorithm that integrates a typical Wi-Fi indoor positioning system with a PDR system is proposed in this paper. The strength of the PDR system should eliminate the weakness of the Wi-Fi positioning system and vice versa. The intelligent fusion algorithm can retrieve the initial user location and moving direction information without requiring any user intervention. Experimental results show that the proposed positioning system has better positioning accuracy than the PDR system or Wi-Fi positioning system alone.},

	abstract = {Wi-Fi localization is currently the most promising approach to build indoor localization systems. Especially after the recent release of Google Indoor Map for the Android system smart phones, many companies such like Skyhook and TCS etc. have flourished into the business of developing accurate Wi-Fi based indoor localization techniques due to their numerous applications. In this paper, we proposed an accurate Wi-Fi based indoor localization algorithm with the help of Google Indoor Map. The initial position of the mobile station (MS) is estimated according to the received signal strength (RSS) from the calibrated Wi-Fi access points (APs). Then, the position of the MS is allocated by using the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to search for a better solution. During the searching process, the SA takes the indoor map structure into consideration and updates the cost function weights accordingly. This procedure makes sure the final estimation reaches to a better convergence. Extensive experimental results confirm that our solution is able to provide a much better result compared with other existing indoor localization techniques.},
