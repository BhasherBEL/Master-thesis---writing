	abstract = {The potential of Information and Communication Technology-enhanced visitor learning experience is increasing with the advancement of new and emerging technologies in art gallery settings. However, studies on the visitor learning experience using wearable devices, and in particular, those investigating the effects of wearable augmented reality on the learning experience within cultural heritage tourism attractions are limited. Using the generic learning outcomes framework, this study aims to assess how the wearable augmented reality application enhances visitor’s learning experiences. Forty-four volunteers who were visiting an art gallery were divided into two groups, an experimental group and a control group. Following their visit to the gallery, the volunteers, who had and had not used wearable computing equipment, were interviewed, and the data were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings revealed that the wearable augmented reality application helps visitors to see connections between paintings and personalize their learning experience. However, there are some drawbacks such as lack of visitor–visitor engagement and the social acceptability.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a technique for indoor localization using the Monte Carlo localization (MCL) algorithm. The MCL was upgraded from Markov localization, with both belonging to the family of probabilistic approaches. Throughout the last decade, laser rangefinders and gyroscopes have been applied to MCL-based robotic localization systems with remarkable success. However, the utilization of MCL-based indoor localization for mobile devices, by applying Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors, is still being researched. In this paper, we present a technique that utilizes MCL that exploits two sensors, namely, the accelerometer and compass, with commonly deployed BLE beacons to localize people with mobile devices indoors. Experimental results illustrate that, by applying MCL with BLE beacons using an accelerometer and compass, the error of the calculated coordinates for the user position is less than 1 m in line of-sight (LOS) environments, while in a complex non-LOS environment, the average error is 3 m. Meanwhile, the proposed MCL system does not demand a high deployment density of BLE beacons compared with triangulation and trilateration-based indoor positioning algorithms.},

Results are integrated into a weighted framework in order to increase the adaptability of the proposed localization algorithm to different complex environments and increase the accuracy of the localization. Three experiments in different environments have been examined in order to test the performance and the limitations of this algorithm.

Outdoor localization can use GPS, AGPS (Assisted Global Positioning System) [6], but in buildings like supermarkets and underground parking, the accuracy of GPS and even AGPS will be greatly reduced. Since Indoor localization requests higher accuracy, using GPS or AGPS for indoor localization is not feasible in the current view. RSSI-based trilateral localization algorithm, due to its low cost, no additional hardware support, and easy-understanding, it becomes the mainstream localization algorithm in wireless sensor networks. With the development of wireless sensor networks and smart devices, the number of WIFI access point in these buildings is increasing, as long as a mobile smart device can detect three or three more known WIFI hotspots’ positions, it would be relatively easy to realize self-localization (Usually WIFI access points locations are fixed). The key problem is that the RSSI value is relatively vulnerable to the influence of the physical environment, causing large calculation error in RSSI-based localization algorithm. The paper proposes an improved RSSI-based algorithm, the experimental results show that compared with original RSSI-based localization algorithms the algorithm improves the localization accuracy and reduces the deviation.},

	abstract = {The accelerating advancement of 5G networks, Internet of Things, and data processing methods in the 21st century raised people's demand for location-based services, especially the indoor locating services. Therefore, indoor locating services have gradually replaced outdoor locating services to become a new research focus and challenge. Given that the traditional indoor locating systems, which are largely based on positioning technologies such as WiFi and radar, performed unsatisfactorily in terms of cost and, the most vital, accuracy.The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has become the core of the Internet of Things and has been widely utilized to tackle the difficulties in the indoor location during the past ten years. The present study analyzed and compared the working principles, research status, and the pros and cons of several commonly used wireless sensors, and drew a conclusion that single indoor locating technology inevitably comes with corresponding limitations, which can be solved through the combination of multiple complementary locating technology. This paper employed UWB and BLE as the subsystems of the indoor combination locating system, analyzed and optimized the respective locating algorithm model of each subsystem, and proposes an optimization model for combination locating algorithm based on EKF-PF, to enhance the accuracy. Eventually, we built a novel set of low-cost, convenient and flexible indoor combination locating system based on Bluetooth-UWB technology that supports both two-dimensional and three-dimensional spatial location.},

	abstract = {With the widely deployed wireless access points (APs) and the worldwide popularization of smartphones, WiFi-based indoor positioning has attracted great attention to both industry and academia. Locating and tracking objects within an indoor environment plays an important role in Internet of Things application and service. However, it is a challenging problem to achieve high accuracy using WiFi positioning technique due to the high instability in received signal strength from AP. Thus, it is desirable to select APs by considering both signal strength and connection quality. In this article, an AP selection algorithm based on multiobjective optimization is proposed to improve indoor WiFi positioning accuracy. The self-adaptive AP selection algorithm can be easily applied to various real scenarios and the performance of the new method is considerably better than classical algorithms. Learning algorithm is exploited to obtain the optimal solution for the self-adaptive AP selection algorithm. Experiments are conducted and the proposed algorithm is compared with classical algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the self-adaptive AP selection algorithm is at least a few decimeters better than classical algorithms in terms of RMSE of position estimation. Meanwhile, the new method is robust to the random generation of initial particles and normalizing factor as their effect on the positional accuracy is less than 1 decimeter.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) can enable smart infrastructures to provide advanced services to the users. New technological advancement can improve our everyday life, even simple tasks as a visit to the museum. In this article, an indoor localization system is presented, to enhance the user experience in a museum. In particular, the proposed system relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons proximity and localization capabilities to automatically provide the users with cultural contents related to the observed artworks. At the same time, a received signal strength-based technique is used to estimate the location of the visitor in the museum. An Android application is developed to estimate the distance from the exhibits and collect useful analytics regarding each visit and provide a recommendation to the users. Moreover, the application implements a simple Kalman filter in the smartphone, without the need of the cloud, to improve localization, precision and accuracy. Experimental results on distance estimation, location, and detection accuracy show that BLE beacon is a promising solution for an interactive smart museum. The proposed system has been designed to be easily extensible to the IoT technologies and its effectiveness has been evaluated through experimentation.},

	abstract = {In recent years, commodity mobile devices equipped with cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs) have attracted much research and design effort for augmented reality (AR) and robotics applications. Based on such sensors, many commercial AR toolkits and public benchmark datasets have been made available to accelerate hatching and validating new ideas. To lower the difficulty and enhance the flexibility in accessing the rich raw data of typical AR sensors on mobile devices, this paper present the mobile AR sensor (MARS) logger for two of the most popular mobile operating systems, Android and iOS. The logger highlights the best possible synchronization between the camera and the IMU allowed by a mobile device, and efficient saving of images at about 30Hz, and recording the metadata relevant to AR applications. This logger has been tested on a relatively large spectrum of mobile devices, and the collected data has been used for analyzing the sensor characteristics. We see that this application will facilitate research and development related to AR and robotics, so it has been open sourced at https://github.com/OSUPCVLab/mobile-ar-sensor-logger.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in indoor positioning systems are based on infrastructure-free solutions, aimed at improving the location accuracy in complex indoor environments without the use of specialized resources. A popular infrastructure-free solution for indoor positioning is a calibration-based positioning, commonly known as fingerprinting. Fingerprinting solutions require extensive and error-free surveys of environments to build radio-map databases, which play a key role in position estimation. Fingerprinting also requires random updates of the database, when there are significant changes in the environment or a decrease in the accuracy. The calibration of the fingerprinting database is a time-consuming and laborious effort that prevents the extensive adoption of this technique. In this paper, we present a systematic LOCALIzation approach, “LOCALI”, for indoor positioning, which does not require a calibration database and extensive updates. The LOCALI exploits the floor plan/wall map of the environment to estimate the target position by generating radio maps by integrating path-losses over certain trajectories in complex indoor environments, where triangulation using time information or the received signal strength level is highly erroneous due to the fading effects caused by multi-path propagation or absorption by environmental elements or varying antenna alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that by using the map information and environmental parameters, a significant level of accuracy in indoor positioning can be achieved. Moreover, this process requires considerably lesser effort compared to the calibration-based techniques.},

In this survey, the authors divide WiFi-based indoor positioning techniques into the active positioning technique and the passive positioning technique based on whether the target carries certain devices. After reviewing a large number of excellent papers in the related field, the authors make a detailed summary of these two types of positioning techniques.

Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) systems, which rely on inertial sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, or even magnetometers to estimate users’ movement, have also been widely adopted for real-time indoor pedestrian location tracking. Since both kinds of systems have their own advantages and disadvantages, a maximum likelihood-based fusion algorithm that integrates a typical Wi-Fi indoor positioning system with a PDR system is proposed in this paper. The strength of the PDR system should eliminate the weakness of the Wi-Fi positioning system and vice versa. The intelligent fusion algorithm can retrieve the initial user location and moving direction information without requiring any user intervention. Experimental results show that the proposed positioning system has better positioning accuracy than the PDR system or Wi-Fi positioning system alone.},

	abstract = {Wi-Fi localization is currently the most promising approach to build indoor localization systems. Especially after the recent release of Google Indoor Map for the Android system smart phones, many companies such like Skyhook and TCS etc. have flourished into the business of developing accurate Wi-Fi based indoor localization techniques due to their numerous applications. In this paper, we proposed an accurate Wi-Fi based indoor localization algorithm with the help of Google Indoor Map. The initial position of the mobile station (MS) is estimated according to the received signal strength (RSS) from the calibrated Wi-Fi access points (APs). Then, the position of the MS is allocated by using the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to search for a better solution. During the searching process, the SA takes the indoor map structure into consideration and updates the cost function weights accordingly. This procedure makes sure the final estimation reaches to a better convergence. Extensive experimental results confirm that our solution is able to provide a much better result compared with other existing indoor localization techniques.},
