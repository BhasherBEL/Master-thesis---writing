	abstract = {Localization and tracking of personnel and equipment are technical issues that urgently need to be solved for Indoor positioning. To improve the accuracy and environmental adaptability of personnel and equipment localization algorithms in the construction and operation of smart water platform, this paper proposes a fingerprint localization algorithm (KF-KNN) based on FM signals. Firstly, use FM data collection device to obtain RSSI fingerprint information within the coverage area, and train them to build a fingerprint database; secondly, KNN technology is used to complete the rough localization calculation based on the RSSI data received by the module to be located, the RSSI fingerprint database and environmental noise parameters; finally, the Kalman filter model is used to predict and optimize the rough position information, so as to have better environmental adaptability and effectively improve the accuracy of localization. The analysis results show that: compared with the original KNN and WKNN fingerprint localization models, the KF-KNN algorithm has better performance in localization, and its average localization error can be as low as 1.9 meters.},

It is well known that NFC is a kind of short distance communication for portable terminals such smart phones and tablet devices. The communication area of NFC is limited in a narrow area; therefore, NFC may be used to locate the position of the area. To realize the automatic guidance and navigation, we present a new data architecture to contain the location information, and an evaluation function to calculate the optical exhibition candidates for the visitors. The feature of the function is considering the popularity of the exhibition and movement distance between the exhibition spots. To implement the service, we developed an application to support editing the map, and create the map data for the portable terminals. It is conÔ¨Årmed that the system provide a good performance based on the experiment in museum.},

	abstract = {The accelerating advancement of 5G networks, Internet of Things, and data processing methods in the 21st century raised people's demand for location-based services, especially the indoor locating services. Therefore, indoor locating services have gradually replaced outdoor locating services to become a new research focus and challenge. Given that the traditional indoor locating systems, which are largely based on positioning technologies such as WiFi and radar, performed unsatisfactorily in terms of cost and, the most vital, accuracy.The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has become the core of the Internet of Things and has been widely utilized to tackle the difficulties in the indoor location during the past ten years. The present study analyzed and compared the working principles, research status, and the pros and cons of several commonly used wireless sensors, and drew a conclusion that single indoor locating technology inevitably comes with corresponding limitations, which can be solved through the combination of multiple complementary locating technology. This paper employed UWB and BLE as the subsystems of the indoor combination locating system, analyzed and optimized the respective locating algorithm model of each subsystem, and proposes an optimization model for combination locating algorithm based on EKF-PF, to enhance the accuracy. Eventually, we built a novel set of low-cost, convenient and flexible indoor combination locating system based on Bluetooth-UWB technology that supports both two-dimensional and three-dimensional spatial location.},

	abstract = {With the widely deployed wireless access points (APs) and the worldwide popularization of smartphones, WiFi-based indoor positioning has attracted great attention to both industry and academia. Locating and tracking objects within an indoor environment plays an important role in Internet of Things application and service. However, it is a challenging problem to achieve high accuracy using WiFi positioning technique due to the high instability in received signal strength from AP. Thus, it is desirable to select APs by considering both signal strength and connection quality. In this article, an AP selection algorithm based on multiobjective optimization is proposed to improve indoor WiFi positioning accuracy. The self-adaptive AP selection algorithm can be easily applied to various real scenarios and the performance of the new method is considerably better than classical algorithms. Learning algorithm is exploited to obtain the optimal solution for the self-adaptive AP selection algorithm. Experiments are conducted and the proposed algorithm is compared with classical algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the self-adaptive AP selection algorithm is at least a few decimeters better than classical algorithms in terms of RMSE of position estimation. Meanwhile, the new method is robust to the random generation of initial particles and normalizing factor as their effect on the positional accuracy is less than 1 decimeter.},

In particular, the proposed system relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons proximity and localization capabilities to automatically provide the users with cultural contents related to the observed artworks. At the same time, a received signal strength-based technique is used to estimate the location of the visitor in the museum. An Android application is developed to estimate the distance from the exhibits and collect useful analytics regarding each visit and provide a recommendation to the users. Moreover, the application implements a simple Kalman filter in the smartphone, without the need of the cloud, to improve localization, precision and accuracy. Experimental results on distance estimation, location, and detection accuracy show that BLE beacon is a promising solution for an interactive smart museum.

Based on such sensors, many commercial AR toolkits and public benchmark datasets have been made available to accelerate hatching and validating new ideas. To lower the difficulty and enhance the flexibility in accessing the rich raw data of typical AR sensors on mobile devices, this paper present the mobile AR sensor (MARS) logger for two of the most popular mobile operating systems, Android and iOS. The logger highlights the best possible synchronization between the camera and the IMU allowed by a mobile device, and efficient saving of images at about 30Hz, and recording the metadata relevant to AR applications. This logger has been tested on a relatively large spectrum of mobile devices, and the collected data has been used for analyzing the sensor characteristics. We see that this application will facilitate research and development related to AR and robotics, so it has been open sourced at https://github.com/OSUPCVLab/mobile-ar-sensor-logger.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in indoor positioning systems are based on infrastructure-free solutions, aimed at improving the location accuracy in complex indoor environments without the use of specialized resources. A popular infrastructure-free solution for indoor positioning is a calibration-based positioning, commonly known as fingerprinting. Fingerprinting solutions require extensive and error-free surveys of environments to build radio-map databases, which play a key role in position estimation. Fingerprinting also requires random updates of the database, when there are significant changes in the environment or a decrease in the accuracy. The calibration of the fingerprinting database is a time-consuming and laborious effort that prevents the extensive adoption of this technique. In this paper, we present a systematic LOCALIzation approach, ‚ÄúLOCALI‚Äù, for indoor positioning, which does not require a calibration database and extensive updates. The LOCALI exploits the floor plan/wall map of the environment to estimate the target position by generating radio maps by integrating path-losses over certain trajectories in complex indoor environments, where triangulation using time information or the received signal strength level is highly erroneous due to the fading effects caused by multi-path propagation or absorption by environmental elements or varying antenna alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that by using the map information and environmental parameters, a significant level of accuracy in indoor positioning can be achieved. Moreover, this process requires considerably lesser effort compared to the calibration-based techniques.},

Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) systems, which rely on inertial sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, or even magnetometers to estimate users‚Äô movement, have also been widely adopted for real-time indoor pedestrian location tracking. Since both kinds of systems have their own advantages and disadvantages, a maximum likelihood-based fusion algorithm that integrates a typical Wi-Fi indoor positioning system with a PDR system is proposed in this paper. The strength of the PDR system should eliminate the weakness of the Wi-Fi positioning system and vice versa. The intelligent fusion algorithm can retrieve the initial user location and moving direction information without requiring any user intervention. Experimental results show that the proposed positioning system has better positioning accuracy than the PDR system or Wi-Fi positioning system alone.},

Especially after the recent release of Google Indoor Map for the Android system smart phones, many companies such like Skyhook and TCS etc. have flourished into the business of developing accurate Wi-Fi based indoor localization techniques due to their numerous applications. In this paper, we proposed an accurate Wi-Fi based indoor localization algorithm with the help of Google Indoor Map. The initial position of the mobile station (MS) is estimated according to the received signal strength (RSS) from the calibrated Wi-Fi access points (APs). Then, the position of the MS is allocated by using the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to search for a better solution. During the searching process, the SA takes the indoor map structure into consideration and updates the cost function weights accordingly. This procedure makes sure the final estimation reaches to a better convergence. Extensive experimental results confirm that our solution is able to provide a much better result compared with other existing indoor localization techniques.},
